/* Internet Explorer and the Expanding Box Problem.
It's an unfortunate fact that Internet Explorer will always incorrectly expand any dimensionally restricted block element so that oversize content is unable to overflow, as the specs require that content to do. The W3C says a rigidly sized block box should allow oversize content to protrude or overflow beyond the edges of the sized box.
The following rule instructs Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6 to break words into the next line instead of expanding the block element.
